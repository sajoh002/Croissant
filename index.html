    <p class="px-5">
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named for its historical
      crescent shape and, like other viennoiserie, are made of a layered
      yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded
      several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique
      called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture,
      similar to a puff pastry.

    <h2 class="text-center mt-3">History</h2>
    <p class="px-5">
      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
      crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. Croissants have long been
      a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French bakeries and p√¢tisseries. The
      modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century. In the late
      1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, pre-formed but unbaked
      dough made them into a fast food that can be freshly baked by unskilled
      labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a
      French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30‚Äì40% of the
      croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen
      dough.
